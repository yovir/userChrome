# userChrome.css

My personal configuration for Firefox, taken from reddit and ShadowFox.

## How to use

* Go to `about:support` using the address bar.

* Look for a **Profile Folder** and open it.

* Look for a folder titled **chrome**.

     *  If it exists, open it up and look for a file called `userChrome.css`.
          
          * If that file exists, copy and paste that code into it.

          * If it doesn't, use a text editor to create a new file (called `userChrome.css`), and place it in there.


   *  If it doesn't, create one with the name **chrome** (case sensitive), create the file (as above) and put it in.

* Restart your browser.
