# userChrome.css

My personal configuration for Firefox, taken from reddit and ShadowFox.

## How to use

* Go to `about:support` using the address bar.

* Look for a **Profile Folder** and open it.

* Look for a folder named **chrome**.

     *  If it exists, open it up and move every files from this repo into it.
     *  If it doesn't, create one with the name **chrome** (case sensitive), and do the same as above.

* Open 'userChrome.css' in your prefered text editor and look for 'firefoxprofilepath' and change it to your Firefox profile path, then save the file.

* Restart your browser.
